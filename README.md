Excited to Share My Latest Project at Prodigy InfoTech! 


I've recently created an engaging Java program for a Number Guessing Game. This game challenges players to guess a randomly generated number, providing hints on whether their guess is too high or too low until they get it right. Utilizing Java and its core libraries, I developed a fun and interactive tool that offers clear instructions and feedback.

ðŸ“Š Key Features:

Random number generation
User input handling with real-time feedback
Count of attempts displayed upon guessing correctly
Console-based interface for easy interaction

ðŸ”§ Technical Skills Showcased:

Java Programming
Efficient user input handling
Implementation of loops and conditionals for game mechanics
Design of a user-friendly console interface
A huge thank you to Prodigy InfoTech for the support!
